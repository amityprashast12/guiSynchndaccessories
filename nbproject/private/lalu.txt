Fact 1: According to IPCC 2007 report, sea levels will rise by 7-23 inches by the end of this century due to global warming.

Fact 2: Since 1880, the average temperature has risen by 1.4-Fahrenheit degrees.

Fact 3: The last two decades of the 20th century have been hottest in the last 400 years, according to climate studies.

Fact 4: The Arctic is one of the worst places to be effected by global warming.

Fact 5: According to the multinational Arctic Climate Impact Assessment report compiled between 2000 and 2004, the average temperature in Alaska, Western Canada and Russia have risen at twice the global average.

Fact 8: The Arctic ice is melting rapidly. By 2040 the region is expected to have a completely ice free summer, or even earlier.

Fact 9: The Montana Glacier National Park has only 25 glaciers instead of 150 that were there in the year 1910.

Fact 10: Due to global warming and pollution, coral reefs are suffering the worst bleaching with the highest dying record since 1980.

Fact 11: Global warming that is causing extreme weather changes has shown it implications in the way of forest fires, heat waves and severe tropical storms throughout the world.

Fact 12: There has been a tremendous increase of water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane nitrous oxide and especially greenhouse gases due to polluting substances emitted as a result of industrialization, pollution, deforestation.

Fact 13: Humans are emitting more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, faster  than the absorbing rates of plants and the oceans.

Fact 14: Sea levels have risen about 7 inches in the in the last 100 years, which is more than the previous 2000 years combined. The rising sea levels due to global warming could threaten the lives of people living along the coastal areas.


 
Fact 15: Around 100 million people live with 3 feet of sea level and many cities of the world are located near such vulnerable coastal areas.

Fact 16: Melting of glaciers will cause sea levels to rise on one hand and water shortages in areas that depend on natural sources of water.

Fact 17: More than 1 million species have become extinct due to disappearing habitats, ecosystems acidic oceans all caused due to global warming.
